Our experimental project will be called MathworldVR, which sets to explore the possibilities and introduce novel methods of using web technologies for creating room-scale, immersive learning environment in virtual reality for helping students to explore, learn about and experiment with various parametrized functions. Itâ€™s also a practical tool for teachers to showcase abstract concepts in concrete 3D space during lectures.
